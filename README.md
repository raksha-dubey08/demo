Here are some programs in C language:-

1.Write a program to print: “Hello World”.

2.Write a program to print sum of two numbers.

3.Write a program that prompts the user to enter their name and age and print the same.

4.Write a program to add two numbers, take number from user and print the sum.

5.Write a Program to print the address in multiple lines.

6.Write a Program to input a number by user and check whether it is a prime number or not.

7.Write a Program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle based on its length and width.

8.⁠Write a program to Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32.

9.Write a program to read a four digit integer and print the sum of its digits.

10.Write a program to demostrate the use of post(x++) and pre(++x) increment on a variable and also print the value.

11. Write a C program that takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.11

12.Using nested if
Write a C program to take a person’s age as input and check if they are eligible to vote.
If the age is 18 or more, print "Eligible to vote".
If the age is less than 18, check again:
If the age is less than 0, print "Invalid age".
Otherwise, print "Not eligible to vote".

90–100  Grade A
75–89  Grade B
50–74  Grade C
Below 50  Grade F

14.Write a C program that takes a number (1–7) as input and prints the corresponding day of the week using a switch case.
1  Monday
2 Tuesday, and so on
If the user enters a number outside 1–7, print "Invalid input"
